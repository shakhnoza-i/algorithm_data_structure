bigO - to compare two solutions
Time comlpexity - it is measured in the number of operations performed
Space comlpexity - measured by size of memory space is taken for operations

5. BigO: worst case
O - omicron (algorithm and data structure efficiency in worst case) like lim->âˆž

7. BigO: drop constants
For O(2n) - we drop constants so O(2n)->O(n) so the constant value doesn't matter

8. BigO: O(n^2)
Example for O(n^2) - when we have 1 for loop inside another. O(n^3)->O(n^2)

9. BigO: drop non-dominants
O(n^2) + O(n) -> O(n^2 + n) -> O(n^2)

10. BigO: O(1) - constant time - most efficient

11. BigO: O(log(n))
