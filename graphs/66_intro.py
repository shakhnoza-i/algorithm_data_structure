"""
Graphs are the go to data structure when you need to represent entities and 
the relationships between them
Node in graph - vertex, vertices - plural
Connection between vertices - edge
There is no limit to how many other vertices particular vertex can connect to
Weighted edges have cost - so each road from one vertex to another vertex 
have cost - like in network routing protocols.
Edges can be weighted or non weighted, they can be directional or bidirectional

Bidirectional Graph would be symmetry in Adjacency Matrix(table representation)

Adjacency List represented with dictionary
